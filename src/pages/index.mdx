# Hi, I'm François Best

I am a developer, an [open source](/open-source) lover and a writer from France.

This is my digital garden, where I write about the things I'm working on and
share what I've learned.

## About Me

I live in Nancy (France), but my heart belongs to Grenoble, where my wife
and I met and plan to settle in the near future, with our first child on the way.

I love cycling, both for transportation and tourism. With my friends,
I've toured across 7 countries on my bike, along the French Atlantic
coast, in the Alps and in the Balkans:

This is a screenshot of a progressive web app I made for us to track our
journeys, it's called [Stravels](https://stravels.io) and allowed us to stitch
together our Strava activities onto a map.
