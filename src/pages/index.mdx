# Hi, I'm François Best

I am a developer, an open source lover and a privacy advocate from France.

In the past, I have worked in the pro audio industry on Digital Signal Processing
algorithmics at [Slate Digital](https://slatedigital.com).

These days, I share my work time between freelance web development with [l'Acquéreur](https://lacquereur.com),
and my own projects:

- [Chiffre.io](https://chiffre.io), an end-to-end encrypted analytics SaaS
- [Stravels](https://stravels.io), a progressive web app I made to share cyclo-touring travels with my friends

I like working with the following stack:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- ChakraUI
- Fastify
- [and more...](/uses)

This website is [open source](https://github.com/franky47/francoisbest.com),
and was made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com),
two of my current favourite techs.
