I've been using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build web applications for
my clients, and I really enjoy it. It's simple to pick up, and opinionated just
enough to remove some of the annoying boilerplate of maintaining a React app.

It also makes it very easy to export static sites, a feature I use for this
very blog, as there is no need for a server: the articles are
[versioned on GitHub](https://github.com/franky47/francoisbest.com/tree/develop/src/pages/posts),
compiled from [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to HTML/CSS/JS and uploaded to a static
file hosting service.

A few months ago, an [RFC](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/9524)
was opened to discuss Static Site Generation (SSR) on the Next.js repository.
This blog gave me an occasion to try this feature, to build the index page
found at [francoisbest.com/posts](/posts).

One of the proposed additions in the RFC is a function exported from any page,
that will calculate props only at build time and not at runtime.

Next.js already has one of these opt-in "magic methods" that add functionnality,
`getInitialProps`, to server-side render things. It could have worked to
generate the index server-side, but considering that the list of articles is
a static resource, it would be incredibly wasteful, hence the proposition to
add a new magic method, `getStaticProps`, which runs only at build time.

## Requirements & Specifications

To generate a list of articles, we need the following information:

- A list of all the articles, from the filesystem
- For each article, the exported metadata

From this, we can generate an index that will:

- List only published articles (drafts are unlisted)
- Sort the articles by year/date of publication
- Expose tags as links for filtering by category

## Listing The Articles

Most of the code required to list the articles, extract the metadata is
available in an
[example in the Next.js repository](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/blog-starter/posts/get-blog-posts.js).

I'm going to list some issues I had integrating it.

## When `__dirname` does not work

Because the index lives

## Metadata Import, `require` and Webpack

Each article exports metadata, including the title of the article, its
publication date, some tags, links to other blogging services & discussion
platforms etc..
It looks like this:

```ts
export const meta = {
  title: 'Building A Blog Index With Next.js',
  publicationDate: '2020-02-17',
  tags: ['next.js'],
  alsoPublishedOn: []
}
```

To get access to this metadata, the first thing I tried was to `require` the
MDX file, which gave me this error:

```
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression
```

It turns out webpack does not like runtime expressions in its `require` or
`import` statements, it needs hardcoded paths to do its thing.

A solution that was added as an

is to read the file from the filesystem, extract the metadata block using
a Regex, and `eval` the result.

This is the kind of thing I would never do with external data, but since I'm
only working locally with my own articles, I'm OK to put that behind me.

## Final Code

The source code for the index page can be found along the rest of the articles,
in the [`franky47/francoisbest.com`](https://github.com/franky47/francoisbest.com/blob/d057962039e55262e7629281a6193175bc524e72/src/pages/posts/index.tsx)
repository on GitHub.
